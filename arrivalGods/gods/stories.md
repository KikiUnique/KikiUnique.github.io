title: The Mother of Stories and Lies
---

The Mother of Stories and Lies is commonly thought of as the Old God of Divination, Lies, and The Dead.

## Description
The mother of stories and lies appears as a giant corpse in the center of their realm. Larger than a city this entity lays motionless, eyes staring and unfocused. The mother of stories and lies exists at all times and can see all places. They experience all of time and space as a single point with no concept of linear time as humans understand it. Their body lays still, suspended in that transition from life to death, in perfect stasis. No decay with corrupt them, not attempt can revive them.

Whilst their body is in this state their mind has been free to roam the universe, seeing and experiencing all things. They are filled with knowledge of all that happens and could happen in the world which they may choose to share with humans for the right price. However, due to their inability to understand time as we know it what they share may not be relevant for years to come, or may of need useful years ago and useless to the recipient now. When they wish to interact with the world they can have their mind control a corpse to divulge their secrets or mages and their followers may call to them seeking wisdom, offering a corpse for them to use for a time.

In exchange for their knowledge the Mother of Stories and Lies craves one payment above all others. They crave lies, stories, and fictions. They know all that can be seen, every event, every story told, every novel written. But they do not see inside peoples heads and the lies we tell ours on a daily basis. Whilst they know all, they can not create their own stories, they do not know how. Each new story allows them more control over their ability to create a story and manifest untruths. The mother has the full truth of the universe. Now they seek the full lie of the universe, one story at a time.

## Realm
The realm of the mother of Stories and Lies is a growing garden called the Garden of Lies. In the center of the realm is the body of an old God the size of a city. Around it is a land divided into they stories they know. Each lie they hear, each fiction they learn is added to the garden and cultivated. They mix stories, prune them, encourage growth in new directions, experimenting to see how far a story or lie can be stretched till they fall apart into truth. Their garden is each lie and story manifested, entering their realm you enter an enactment of a fiction brought to a physical world. Each physical enactment, at its bounds, bleeds into the next like over grown boundaries in a garden.
The closer to the mother you get the more subtly the fictions contain as these are their favourites. Lies woven into the very fabric of their enactment that they make logical sense and the removal of the fiction would cause the enactment to no longer function.

## Creatures
The creatures of this realm are those of imagination and are countless. From the monster that lives under the bed to the personification of the idea of people from other peoples minds. If your best friend shared their idea of you with the Mother of Stories and Lies then the idea of you is in there somewhere. The realm is a land of variety, both delight and horror, all of which are considered the Mothers children.
There are no common creature of the mothers' realm. Each entity of the realm could resemble any other creature or no known creature at all. The only way to tell is to observe it and try to find what aspect of the entity is a lie. It won't change or affect the entity but it will give you an idea of what to expect from it.
