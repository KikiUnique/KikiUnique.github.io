# Otherworld Lore

The world before 1000 AD, the stories of supernatural creatures are true to a point. Humans got many things wrong but some of the old stories held the truth if you knew where to look.
The human world and the otherworld overlapped, the otherworld following different natural law to the human world. The law of magic is controled by the ancient fey whose collective believe or concept of reality shapes the laws of their world. The other world is the source of the stories around the fey and other mythical creatures. Many more are the scions of the fey and human, making vampires, werewolves, and other half human creatures. In 1000 AD the forgotten crusade was launched by the human into the otherworld. The humans made it through the wilds, through the fey kingdoms, and to the seats of the ancient fey. Amidst the fighting the humans made it to the ancients and requested a deal. The exact wording was lost with the crusade when the deal was struck but all of humanity learnt what it did when the world changed. For 1000 years the ancient fey, their influence, and the otherworld will leave the human world in peace.

Unfortunately the ancient fey were not influencing the human world. There children had influence over those that struck deals with them but the ancient fey could not shape our world. But the deal was too vague. The ancient fey had not influence already but that would change after 1000 years of seperation. The crusade launched thought they would have 1000 years to prepare for a final confrontation. However, they actually were lost in the otherworld during the separation and signed the world over to the ancient fey when they return. Seperation and no influence did nto stop the otherworld scrying to watch the human world and prepare for time they could claim it as their own.

In the year 2000 AD the connections between the worlds reopened and this time the influence of the ancient fey came flooding through. They had watch the world, learning about what we achieved and saw things they did not agree upon and ensured they would not work in the otherworld should another crusade begin. As their will spread through the world our technology began to fail. Electricity didn't generate from our generators, combustion engines failed to spark, gunpowder would ignite in some cases but any attempt to fire a gun of any variety misfired with each pull of the trigger. Transport fail, infrastructure failed, modern weapons failed. Suddenly we are in a world where most countries and communities couldn't produce enough food to feed themselves, couldn't defend ourselves effectively, and were suddenly set upon my forces string than us.

At first, whilst the fey prepared and mustered their forces. Their first wave was the ancient fey changing the rules, there was no need to rush. The fear of the humans was intoxicating to them. What came next, in the chaos of unheaval, was the beasts and wild things from the otherworlds wilds. They came through and began to stalk the humans, taking joy in the prey they hadn't hunted in so long. Next came the wild hunt, as the prey in the wilds began to diminish the hunters of the wild began hunting in the human world ahead of the fey invasion. Between the change and chaos the human population was decimated before the fey came to claim their new world.

As the fey arrived and took the land they wanted more life was lost. It took time but the world found its new order, now with humans no longer at the top. Trade began between what was left of humanity and the fey of the otherworld. The most valuable resource being traded was information. Knowledge of the ancient feys rules and how to twist their rules to form rituals and magic. With the right symbolic trappings, intent, and willpower humans could use magic in a similar way to the fey. 

It has been years since the world was lost to the fey. Humans have done their best to rebuild and learn their new place in the world. There are now people born to this world that never knew the world before. The humans are divided into many groups and factions but most can be divided into one of the following philosophies.

 - Live and let live (Attempt to get fey to help humanity)
 - Better a favoured pet than a hated pest (Work with fey regardless of their motives)
 - Humans back on top (Working towards restoring order so human are on top)
 - The final crusade (Remove the ancient feys influence on the human world)
 - We can be more powerful (Gather magic knowledge and find the loop holes to enforce our own will)
 - We need our own nation (Reclaim a land just for humans to keep them safe from fey)

# Ancient Fey (The oldest of the fey)
	- Guardian of the shadow lands (Inspired by the Cait Sidhe)
		The guardian of the shadow lands is an ancient feline, its fur black as pitch, its chest shines with an inner light of many colors peaking through its thick fur.
		The guardians descendants are drawn to the souls of those near death. It is not known what they do with such souls but it is thought they bring them to this ancient fey.
		The shadow lands from its name is supposedly a realm no one has ever entered or atleast none has returned. The guardian once spoken to a human that found themselves lost in the other
		world and survived. He performed a service for the guardian and was granted a boon and a question. His boon was to be returned home safely and his questions was "What are the shadow
		lands and awaits those to travel there?" The answer was "I do not know, none can travel there, none can return, not even I". The human then awoke in his bed, a black cat upon his chest
		that followed him for the rest of his days, after which the cat was not seen again.
	- The call of the wild (Goblins)
		The call of the wild is the first Goblin and the source of all goblins. It started as an urge that would coalesce around a concept and create a living being. A coallesing of power that 	
		spawn a consciousness, each time holding its memories perfectly and recalling each incarnation. This ancient fey can draw power from the wilds to a concept inorder to manifect itself.
		The call of the wild is the most chaotic of the ancient fey, its form and manipulations on the world change as it incarnates into different forms. For as 
		long as any can remember the call to the wild as incarnated as a concept so abstract it has no physical form, instead manifesting as the urge that spawns goblins which is why the call 
		of the wild thinks of all goblins as their children. This manifestation is a less powerful version of itself and happens when power builds in a given area. The power building appears 		
		random but some believe the call of the wild directs it for its own whims. But as it is incarnated as a concept that can't communicate, no one knows for sure.
	- Mother of story and nightmare (Lenan Sidhe)
		The mother f story and nightmare has been and always will be. They have existed at all times, at the same time, and aged in all times. Living for all entirety at the same time means 		
		they are always both dead and alive. They are a giant corpse that does not move, it remains where it is both alive and dead, new born and long since dust all at the same time. They have 
		seen everything and know all. They are filled with every story and horror that exists. When they have their mind, body, and universe all in the same place and facing the same direction 
		they can provide great knowledge to those that seek it. However this is rare. What the Mother of story and nightmare craves more than anything if lies, untruths, and fabrications. Not 
		just any but stories. Lives and worlds built on lies as whiilst they know all, they can not create their own stories, they do not know how. Each new story allows them more control over 
		their ability to create a story an maifest untruths. The mother has the full truth of the universe. Now they seek the full lie of the universe, one story at a time.

	- The lose one (Hags)

# Fey (like humans but with more power)
	- Kattos Foscad (Shadow cat)
		Descendants of the Guardian of the shadow lands are few, they are half human, half feline creatures. They stand and move like a human does but their legs are digitigrade, their face has
		a sharp feline sctructure, and their body is covered in short fur. The Kattos Foscad collect human souls to gift to the Guardian of the shadow lands. Each Kattos Foscad believe they are
		doing it for different reasons. They are quite predatory in their interactions, all things are seen through the lens of either being either predator or prey. Predators are to be
		cautiously respected, prey are an amusement at best. All humans are treated as prey until proven otherwise. This does not mean they will not respect anyone they consider prey. An 		
		entertaining hunt could lead to prey surviving for a future hunt. Predators may be treated as a threat and attacked if weakness is found. Kattos Foscad societies are small and built
		from families and prides which are multiple joined families. Within a pride life is relaxed but conflict and posturing between prides are common.
	- Goblins
		Descendants of teh call of the wild might not actually be true descendants. They spawn from the call of the wild, some think they are children of the call of the wild, others think they 
		are extensions and pieces of its vast consciousness. Some have tried to question the goblins about this but they don't understand. It appears Goblins live longer than a single 
		incarnation but they struggle to recall last lives. Some can recall parts of their past lives but it becomes muddled and lost over time. Whilst many other fey have societies and cities, 
		the goblins do not. They manifest anywhere, each manifesting a different concept and not all wish to work together. Many exist for a short time and have their own agendas and desires 
		based on their concept. Occasionally a goblin is created with some sort of agenda or task they work towards from creation. This a rare and usually a sign of the call of the wild 
		desiring something to be done.
	- Deathless Lie (Muse)
		Descendants of the mother of story and nightmare are all born of death. The first lie the mother learnt was that life could be returned after death. The deathless lie are those born of 
		the first lie that the mother learnt. When their first offsprint failed to survive their grief drove the mother to declaring this lie and manifesting the first deathless lie. Now there 
		are more deathless, all created by that first lie. These creature look like corpses no matter how long they have been alive. They will gather stories or lies from those that meet, using 
		powers of inspiration to bring about the lies they need to feed to their mother.
