---

The Shadow Guardians are those that follow the teaching of the Guardian of the Shadow Lands.

## Core Beliefs
The Guardian is very lax in its worship and have only 3 commands for those that follow them.

1. You shall walk the path to Shadow Lands. Your final step shall bring you to me. I shall escort you to the Shadow Lands.
2. The hunt is the truest act of the faithful. No bruteforce, instead use cunning, prepare, and plan your attack. Hunts come in all shape and sizes, find yours but never forget the duty to the shadow lands.
3. Not everyone should go to the shadow lands, ensure you choose wisely which souls you collect. You will enter the lands one day, ensure the Shadow Lands will be a safe and comfortable place when you arrive.

## Roles
### Shepard
The leader of a Shadow Guardian group

### Guardian
The member fo the group who performs the ritual to take a fragment of initiates souls and guards them from those that might take them or do them harm.

### Shadow Claw
Fighters for the Shadow Guardian. Souls remain a connection to their corpse for a time after death but not all people die in safe locations. Shadow Claws are fighters that help retrieve souls from dangerous locations

### Gatherer
Members that gather souls for the Shadow Lands. These are dedicated mages of the Shadow Guardians all of which know the ritual to collect a fragment of a soul causing the soul to remain in this world ready to be escorted to the Shadow Lands.

### Hunter
General members of the shadow guardians. They go out and seek those that would make good additions to the Shadow Lands. Once they have identified someone they believe to be worthy they will make the offer and attempt to convince the person to permit their soul to be gathered. They do not attempt to convince them to join the faith as they see this as poaching and they do not see this as a worthy hunt.

## Look and Feel

### Color
The Shadow Guardians favour dark colors. Small bits of lighter shades for accents but the majority of their attire would be dark regardless of the actual color. Those that are particulary faithful make have a white, grey, or silver triangle on their chest to mimic the appearance of their Old God.

### Clothing
Clothing for the Shadow Guardians stays away from flowing and baggy clothing. They favour practicality over elaborate fashion. Even the newest Hunter dresses ready for travel through the wild and dangerous parts of the world. Ready to join the hunt at any given time. 

They have no preference on clothing, often mixing modern and historical styles of clothing based on practicality. It is not uncommon to see modern jeans and T-shirt layered with leather bracers and greaves and a wool hood and cloak.

### Inspirations
Cowboy
Lord of the Rings Ranger


## Traditions


All who become a Child of Stories look to gather the stories of others, each others personal perspectives of the events they have seen. Some will try to interview people, others just listen intently and try not to engage. More common is for Children of Stories to make a campfire, start a meal, and start telling stories they have learnt whilst encouraging others to join in. Then on some nights, the Children of Stories will have a dream that feels real, and somewhere in the dream is a corpse that appears out of place. The corpse speak to them and asks what they have learnt, and the Child speaks the stories they have to the Mother of Stories and Lies.
