The followers of the Mother of Stories and Lies call themselves a Child of Stories. There is no organisation to the followers, each follower has their own personal connection to the Mother of Stories and Lies.
All who become a Child of Stories look to gather the stories of others, each others personal perspectives of the events they have seen. Some will try to interview people, others just listen intently and try not to engage. More common is for Children of Stories to make a campfire, start a meal, and start telling stories they have learnt whilst encouraging others to join in. Then on some nights, the Children of Stories will have a dream that feels real, and somewhere in the dream is a corpse that appears out of place. The corpse speak to them and asks what they have learnt, and the Child speaks the stories they have to the Mother of Stories and Lies.
