- Blows must not make contact, leave a foot between weapon and target
- Hits no faster than 1 per second and damage/level must be called
- Any calls must be made clear to the target (brief description if they aren't facing you)

    - Your armour can withstand a number of blows equal to your armour rating for blows equal to or less than your armour rating.
    - Number of blows armour has taken refreshed between events or after receiving maintenance or repair with the appropriate skill (must be removed to be repaired).
    - If you receive a blow greater than your armour rating or after the number of blows it can withstand the armour is broken and becomes useless till repaired.
- Any blow taken when armour is 0 adds you your damage count.
