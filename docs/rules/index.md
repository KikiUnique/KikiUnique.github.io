- Many skills 
- Skills take varying amounts of time to complete. This is determined either by the skill or the object being interacted with.
- Skills have a level which is important to its use.
    - Some skills might have uses that require a minimum level
    - Some items or specific uses might require a minimum level (the object will have a note attached to inform you)
