# Downtime and advancement
After each session you play you are granted a downtime for your character to perform actions between sessions. During this time you can craft items, train skills, perform jobs or mission iven by NPCs, or explore. The results of your actions will be determined by the Ref team. Each slot provides some benefit for your character even if they are not immediately obvious.

Yur downtime is split into 4 slots, each representing a week of game time where you can focus on an action.
- Each slot is a different week in the gap between events. All actions requiring multiple players must be in the same slot and you must mention who you are working with.
- Each slot will provide you with different things depending on the action specified.
- Downtime can help tp increase your skills, by adding xp to a skill. The required amount of xp is the number of the next level of that skill.
- Most downtime actions will provide a point of XP towards a skill although the skill that gains the XP might not be obvious.
