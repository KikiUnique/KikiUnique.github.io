title: The Dead God
---

The Dead God is commonly thought of as the God of consumption, machines and order.

## Description
The Dead God is composed of a large humanoid machine, half formed in the center of its realm. Its appearance is that of a metallic skeleton half submerged in the ground in a pose that appears as if it was pulling itself from the ground. The god is motionless and the surrounding machinery appears to have no power or minimal power and barely functions.
Little more is known of the Dead God as they do not move and do not speak. Wanders in its realm have found machines that have powered on for short periods of time which displayed text, played audio, or allowed some level on interaction. Whilst most of these made little sense to those that were there to see, some contained messages that was deemed to be from the Dead God.
The Dead God requires energy and draws it from anything in its realm and since the arrival of the Gods it has been draining energy from the human world. Power plants, batteries, and lightning are just a few examples causing them to not function as they once did. Even a living creatures life force can be siphoned off although most people never notice.
One day the Dead God might awaken and its need for power could lead it to consuming more than it currently does.

## Realm
Often called the metal wastes, the Dead Gods realm is hostile to the living unless you go prepared. All living things in the wastes have their life force striped from them. We don't know exactly what this means and what is being lost but the longer a living thing spends in the realm the slower and weaker them become until their body stops. This can be slowed and potentially avoided in 3 different ways. The first is to be a follower of the Dead God, if you have fed the Dead God enough recently you are ignored for a time, the draw from you lessening and allowing you to stay longer in the realm. The other way is to bring along something to be drained instead of you. In a local area the weakest or most injured is drawn from first, bringing an injured animal or person will give you additional time. The final way is to bring a charge stone with you, the energy from a charge stone will be drained first, granting you more time in the realm.
The realms is a desert of metal sand containing metal bodies, machines, and structures. Most of these are partially submerged beneath the surface. Many thrum with energy but few of those appear to function. It is rare indeed to find a functional device, creature, or structure. Charge stones are made from the remnant bones left by those that have been drained in this realm. Once they have been drained, a ritual to the Dead God will allow you to request a charge stone for a price. If the deal is accepted a piece of bone left by a dead creature in the realm will manifest markings and metal bands allowing it to function for a specific purpose. Once complete you must enter the realm to retrieve it. It can only appear to those that were part of the ritual.
These charge stones are highly priced in the human world. Whilst most have adapted to life without technology there are still some that try to hold to the old world and others that need some level of technological aid. This makes the charge stones highly priced thought the limitations of a stone makes their transfer between people difficult at times.

## Creatures
There are no known living creatures native to the realm of the Dead God.
Some explorers have found metal structures that look like they might be creatures. These structures are motionless and could be statues and not actual creatures. Some have been found that hum internally as if power is flowing within, yet they do not respond to any stimuli.

Messages and details found on some of the partially powered machines indicate that these structures are creatures of the realm but the details they provided was incomplete, corrupted, and no live versions have been seen.

## Followers
The followers of the Dead God call themselves the cult of the dead god. Unlike other followers that can commune with their God the cult can not. They receive messages from the partially working machines of the realm. These messages are often nonsensical but the cult follow any instructions and derive meaning from them. This leads to cult to act erratically making them unpredictable.
