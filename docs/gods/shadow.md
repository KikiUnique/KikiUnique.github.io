title: The Guardian of the Shadow Lands
---

The Guardian of the shadow lands is commonly thought of as the Old God of Death, The Hunt, and Darkness.

## Description
The guardian of the shadow lands is a huge ancient creature with a feline appearance unlike any feline from the human world. The size of a cruise ship with fur that was once black as pitch with grey flecked around the head and face. Its chest shines with an inner light of many colors peaking through its thick fur. The guardians body is covered in cuts and half healed scars from the conflicts whilst defending the shadow lands.
Despite the guardians appearance it is able to speak any language of those that have been escorted to the shadow lands. 
  
## Realm
The Realm of the Guardian of the Shadow Lands is called the Border lands. The border lands appears as a desert of grey sand under a white sky. On the horizon is a black glow that is the limit of the Guardians Realm and the start of the Shadow Lands. The shadow lands is a realm no one has ever entered, or if they have, at least none have returned. Word has spread of a human that performed a service for the guardian and was granted a boon and a questions. Different versions of the story say he asked for different boons but the question as is always told to be the same. "What are the shadow lands and awaits those to travel there?" The answer was "I do not know, I can not enter and none who enter have returned.".
The border lands are a violent place, with the different creatures of the realm fighting each other for some long forgotten reason.

## Creatures
The creatures from the guardians realm are drawn to the souls of those near death or recently dead. They take the souls and escort them to the border lands where the Guardian will escort them to the Shadow lands. There are many different beliefs about the shadow lands and some people wish to have their soul enter, others do not. This leads to many reactions to these creatures or their followers showing up near the dead. Some will make a case for their soul to be taken, others make deals or attempt to fight them off to prevent it.
There are only 2 types of creature in the border lands.

### Felisian
Felisians are feline creatures of different shapes and sizes. They tend to travel in groups of similar size and shape. In the human world felisians have been encountered up to the size of the big cats native to that world. In the border lands encounters with felisians up to the size of a bus have been encountered. Not all Felisians are able to speak human languages, the smaller ones can not but the larger they are the greater the chance that they have learnt how to speak with humans.
Felisians are often covered in old wounds from Charonians and hostile encounters with humans that do not wish their soul to enter the shadow lands. Scars, scabs and open wounds are common amongst them. Whilst they may look similar to the Guardian their chest does not glow unless they are carrying a soul to deliver to the Guardian.


### Charonian
Charonians are the second of the creatures you will encounter that originate from the border lands. Humanoid shaped but with no standard proportions. The common trait amongst them is that their body follows typical human proportions in general but some body parts will be exaggerated. Overly large or broad arm, over-sized chest, there is always some body part or several that are larger than exacted compared to the rest of the body. The Charonian are unable to speak the human lanugages, they appear able to communicate between themselves. One might think them mindless creatures but they have been seen communication and planning which indicates intelligence and future planning. The Charonian have been found in different shapes and sizes with the ones encountered in the human world ranging across the full spectrum of typical human heights, in the border lands choranians the height of a building have been encountered.
The Charonians have a hunger for human flesh and seek out the dead and nearly dead in order to consume them, but they seem uninterested if the bodies soul was taken by a Felisian. Charonians will get aggressive to defend a corpse they wish to eat and fight with a feral energy, attacking any that get too close including other Charonians. When there is nothing to eat nearby they roam around looking for bodies to eat. They may not seem aggressive when roaming but any acts of violence or harm near them can cause them to get aggressive only ending if they are significantly injured or they get a new body to feed upon.

## Followers
The followers of the Guardian of the Shadow Lands call themselves Shadow Guardians and are organised as individual groups or cells and not one unified church. Each group works independent of the others but all follow their Old Gods core beliefs. This can occasionally result in fighting between groups.
All who follow the Guardian of the Shadow Lands believe it is their responsibility to gather souls of humans to enter the shadow lands. They honor death and believe the greatest honor in life is a good death. Upon joining the followers of the Guardian of the Shadow Lands a small fragment of their soul if broken away and kept by their leader. When they die their soul travels to the soul fragment and lingers there for their leaders to protect until a Felisian can collect their souls to start their journey to the Shadow Lands.
