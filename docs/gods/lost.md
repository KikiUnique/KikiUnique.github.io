title: The Lost One
---

The Lost One is commonly thought of as the Old God of Desperation, Deals, and the Cursed.

## Description
The Lost One is mistress of the lost, damned, and forsaken. An eternal wandering, roaming their realm of the lost and forgotten. The Lost One can appear in many different shapes but always appear injured, deformed, broken, or in desperate need in some way. The Lost One has been known to manifest in the human world in this way for two reasons. Either they appear to the desperate to offer them a deal for aid, or to those blessed in some way to test them and grant a boon or a curse.
Whilst their appearance can change the 3 appearance that are most commonly told is that of a dog with a missing ear and a broken paw, a cat with no tail and fresh wound, and an old human wearing layers of rags covering as much skin as possible, hobbling along using a stick for balance, coughing from an unknown illness.

## Realm
The realm of the Lost One is a dark reflection of the wild parts of the human world called the Nowhere. Anyone found in this world finds their luck has turned sour. For bad fortune follows them everywhere they turn. The weather turns poor at inopportune moments, injuries get rapidly worse with infection, items break or go missing. The realm of the Lost One has more connections to the human world than other relams. These connections are in constant flux, shifting locations causing people and things to fall through and be lost. In the wild places of the realm, items lost from the other realms manifest and remain lost. People that fall through the cracks are often blessed by the Lost One and find themselves in the realm to wander, forever lost. Even if they should wander back into their world they will not be recognised and will struggle to stay in the world without being pulled back the Lost Ones Realm.

## Creatures
The creatures of the realm of the Lost One are those that fell through from other realms. These creatures are unable to remain in other worlds for long and find it difficult to be remembered by others. This makes life difficult and often results on these creatures being scarred, injured, wearing torn and broken items. Gathering what broken and forgotten items them can find to try and keep some connection to the places and people they held dear before being lost. Whilst there are many creatures of the realm, below are the details of the more common creatures that originate from the realm.

### Goblins
The Goblins are native creatures of the realm. Their mind is one of loss and confusion with long term memories difficult to form. Whilst a Goblin is in its confused state they are drawn back into the realm if they have travelled from it. They wander lost and confused, gathering things and ideas from those they encounter. Occasionally a Goblins may get an idea, item, or concept in mind that won't leave. With this the Goblin gains a measure of lucidity and an obsession for the thing that gave them their lucidity. When this happens them find a crack to leave the realm for the human world to experience their new obsession. After some time, or maybe when they achieve some goal, the obsession begins to fade and the Goblin feels the draw back to the Nowhere. They will fade from existence as they return to the Nowhere. 
Each Goblin struggles to recall past obsession and moments of lucidity and their reactions and behaviours can vary wildly between individuals. That said it is common for Goblins to rewards those that help them in their obsessions by gifting something which can make aiding them profitable depending on their desires and the lost trinkets they have picked up.

### The Lost
The Lost are not natives to the Nowhere but are people that have fallen through the cracks of the world and found themselves isolated for too long. Sometimes when this happens the Lost One finds them and makes a deal. If they are not found or do not take the deal they may find themselves remaining lost forever. They slip between the gaps and end up in the Nowhere and become lost and forgotten. These individuals are difficult to remember, you can remember the events but their face, personality, and information about the Lost is difficult to recall. These entities live on the fringes of society on the scraps that they can take. Attempts to stay near the same people for more than a day leads the Lost to becoming hated. By the end of the second day they are likely to be attacked and harmed by those that aren't like them. They can pass between the gaps of the world to enter the Nowhere but over time they are drawn back to the Human world whether they want to or not.

## Followers
The followers of the Lost One call themselves the Seekers of Nowhere. They are a large group bound together in tradition. They are divided into groups called pilgrimages despite not all of them partaking in a physical journey. Whether they travel across the lands or routinely search the area around them for cracks between worlds leading them to Nowhere.
