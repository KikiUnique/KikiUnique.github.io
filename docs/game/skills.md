Not every ability is common knowledge to average Neverwas inhabitant and the ways to gain them are just rumours although some may be closer to the truth than others.
Below are the commonly known abilities to starting characters, there are other that exist in the world, however, they are not common knowledge.

- Solving  
These individuals are often called Solvers. It is unclear where the name came from but solvers can "solve" things with just a touch. A lock can be solved into its locked or unlocked state. A message in code can be read as if it is not in code. All known Solvers are part of the Family of Lock and Key. A family made from blood relations and found family, each having the gift. How the gift passed to descendants and found family is a mystery help by the members of the family.
- Speaking  
The individuals are often called Shepherds. They are able to communicate with animals and they animals are able to communicate back. They appear to be able to converse as if the animal has a human mind till the conversation ends. Some believe they are capable of making animals speak in a human voice but this might be pure rumour. Rumours are that an entity in the Neverwas grants this ability to those that perform a service. There are as many descriptions of this entity as there are rumours about it.
- Building  
These individuals are often called Mashers. They are able to make a temporary but usable item in on time at all providing they have the materials needed. The masher takes the raw materials and appears to mach them together. The materials hold in place and function as the item being mashed until the masher no longer wants it then the items falls apart to the materials again. The source of the ability is unknown for certain, but it is believed that it may be related to the fact that each masher has at least 1 limb made out of a material other than flesh.
- Boon
These individuals are often called Charmers. They can make small little trinkets that can bestow a boon of good luck on the wearer for a time. The luck seems to be limited to a specific part of the wearers' life. According to rumour a Charmer is able to grant good luck to others but not themselves. It is also believed that these trinkets only work for the person it is made for. Wearing a trinket from someone else grants a curse equal but opposite to the original boon and can not be removed till the original boon would have run out. There are rumours of some Charmers making trinkets to deliberately curse others, and that Charmers may be able to remove a boon or curse before the boon or curse expires.
