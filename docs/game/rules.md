---

All rules for the game are included on this page. Rules cover general skill use, combat, downtime, and other areas detailed below.

Non-Combat Skill Use
 - Skills can be used in or out of combat but any attack (weather it causes damage or is absorbed by armour) interrupts the skill use and you must start again.
 - Skills take varying amounts of time to complete. This is determined either by the skill or the object being interacted with.
 - Skills have a level which is important to its used.
    - Some skills might have uses that require a minimum level
    - Some items or specific uses might require a minimum level (the object will have a note attached to inform you)
 - Some Skills might only be usable a given number of times for a situation or object after which something changes (item breaks) and prevent further attempts.

Combat
 - Blows must not make contact, leave a foot between weapon and target
 - Hits no faster than 1 per second and damage/level must be called
 - Any calls must be made clear to the target (brief description if they aren't facing you)
 - Your armour gives you an armour rating.
 	- Your armour can withstand a number of blows equal to your armour rating for blows equal to or less than your armour rating.
 	- Number of blows armour has taken refreshed between events or after receiving maintenance or repair with the appropriate skill (must be removed to be repaired).
 	- If you receive a blow greater than your armour rating or after the number of blows it can withstand the armour is broken and becomes useless till repaired.
 - Any blow taken when armour is 0 adds you your damage count.
 - When damage reaches your health threshold you begin to bleed out.
 - When bleeding out the character can not move faster than a slow walk/stagger, can not use skills or weapons.
 	- After 60 seconds you are dead.
 	- Bleed out stops and time resets when any form of healing begins.
 	
Attribute Recovery
 - Health is recovered by the use of Frst aid and recovers at a rate of 1 per week with a full month providing all your health back.
 - Stamina is recovered via the use of certain potions or recovers at dawn of a new day (no matter how you got there)
 - Willpower is recovered via the use of certain potions or recovers at dawn of a new day (no matter how you got there)

Downtime and advancement
 - Downtime is split into 4 slots used to advance you character in some way.
 - Each slot is a different week in the gap between events. All joint actions must be in the same slot.
 - Each slot will provide you with different things depending on the action specified.
 - Each skill requires points spent to increase. The required amount is the number of the next level of that skill. These points are acquired during downtime, each slot will give you a point towards a skill. Occasionally you could gain other benefits instead.
