Arrival of the Old Gods is a LARP that encourages PVE play to survive and faction based PVP to maintain control for yourself, your faction, and/or the God serve.

The modern fantasy setting is designed to make it easy for those new to the hobby to get involved without the need for a large investment. For those that enjoy more involved costume, prosthetics, and make-up there are optional character options from creation and as you progress.

The LARP uses a non-contact combat system but still requires all melee weapons to be LARP safe, ranges weapons must not be loaded or unable to fire projectiles. Nerf guns will be acceptable for firearms.
