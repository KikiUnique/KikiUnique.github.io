title: Calls
---

Sometimes during events there will be things that need to be communicated that can't be done in in character ways. This includes but is not limited to announcements of the game starting and stopping, special effects, and emergency announcements. This is where a call comes into play. A call is announced and its effect should be reacted to by those affected. 

## Rules for Calls
- Calls must be made clear, it is on you to ensure those around you can hear your call.
- The word or phrase used for these calls should be avoided when shouting or speaking loud on site to avoid confusing for other players.
- Misuse of calls or ignoring of call is considered cheating and will result in a warning, continued misuse or ignoring will be reviewed by the refs to determine how best to handle.

## Emergency Calls
- Man Down  
  This call should only be used in case of an emergency due to injury.
  When called the game is paused as per Time Freeze (see below). Everyone should freeze and await further instructions.
	- If you are near the injured person you should ensure the area is clear and there is a path for first-aiders to get to the person as quick as possible.
- Safety  
  This called is used if a situation is becoming unsafe, or you feel unsafe.
  When called the game should stop briefly (as Time Freeze), and raise a hand so show out of character until issue is dealt with. Those in the local area should identify the issue and move away. Once it is agreed to be safe hands can be lowered and the game continues as if the interruption never happened. Further gameplay should avoid the dangerous situation or area.
  - If the issue is something that can be fixed the ref team should be contacted as soon as possible.

    
## OC Game calls
OC Game Calls are used to help in the running of the game. These calls are used exclusively by the ref team. You should be aware of their meaning but should not be calling them in usual play.
- Time In  
  The game has begun, all IC areas are now IC and you are expected to roleplay your character in these area.
- Time Out  
  The game has ended, you should no longer be roleplaying your character.
- Time Freeze  
  The game needs to be paused for some reason, stop what you are doing, safely come to a stop and await further instructions.  
	The game will restart at the next Time In call


## IC Game calls
IC Game calls are used to signal the use fo an ability that can't easily or safely be performed. These allow you to alert players near by and the target of an ability of the effects they may need to roleplay. As always it if your responsibility to ensure the target can hear the call. Each player may roleplay an effect in different manners. If you feel a player is not taking their hits or reacting to an ability you should not approach the player regarding this, tell the ref team and they will handle the situation.
- Block  
  The ability just used on you have been blocked. To use Block you must be able to see the ability taking place, be able to defend yourself (not restrained).  
  If the target is in front of you, you can see the user, and you can move freely you should be able to Block
- Restrained(X) - You are been forcibly restrained in some way, preventing you from moving or defending yourself. You must remain motionless till the specified number of seconds elapses
	- e.g Calling Restained (10) keeps the target restrained for 10 seconds
- Bleed - Your death count is halved, you will lose 1 health once you finish combat (no more active fighting or you retreat to safety), and you continue to lose health every 60 seconds unless receiving medical attention. The first recovered point of health removes the bleed.
- Rend - The hit that accompanies this call counts as 2 hits
- Slow - All rituals, and abilities take twice as long, hits must be no faster than 1 per 2 seconds
