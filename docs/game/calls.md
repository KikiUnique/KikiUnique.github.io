# Calls

Sometimes during events there will be things that need to be communicated that can't be done in in character ways. This includes but is not limited to announcements of the game starting and stopping, special effects, and emergency announcements. This is where a call comes into play. A call is announced and its effect should be reacted to by those affected. The words used for these calls should be avoided when speaking on site to avoid confusing for other players.

- Calls are words or phrases that are used to alert nearby players of an effect.
 - Calls must be made clear, it is on you to ensure those around you can hear your call.
