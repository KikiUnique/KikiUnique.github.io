title: The Otherworld Sentient
---

Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, and have subjective experiences, such as emotions and sensations like pain or pleasure. Sentient creatures also only make an instinctual use of their will. Their will is used without conscious thought and is used for survival or for immediate need. The difference between these and sapient entities is the difference between humans and animals.
