title: The Otherworld Landscapes
---

The landscape of the Otherworld is one of change with pockets of stable environments maintained by the collect will of the inhabitants. The wild lands are the areas where little to no will is used to stable it. THe wild lands are subject to change based on the subconscious and emotions of the Ancient ones. Wild lands closest to an Ancient One is predominantly influenced by that one alone. As the wild lands get further away the influence of multiple Ancient Ones start to have an impact.
Outside of the wild lands are the Other Lands where will keeps the lands mostly stable. The Other Lands are maintained in different ways, some are maintained directly by an Ancient One, often refered to as the City of the Ancients. Others are held stable by the collective will of a group of entities with a common believe in how the Other Land should be. Cities of the Ancients are the most stable of areas, the Other Lands can fluctuate over time or as a result of major events affecting the inhabitants.
