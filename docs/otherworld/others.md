title: The Others
---

The inhabitants of the Otherworld are descendents or creations of the Ancient Ones and pledge allegiance to them. Whilst some may appear to have their own goals and motivations, even rivaliares against one another, they all server their ancient one.

## Kattos Foscad
  Descendants of the Guardian of the shadow lands are few, they are half human, half feline creatures. They stand and move like a human does but their legs are digitigrade, their face has
  a sharp feline sctructure, and their body is covered in short fur. The Kattos Foscad collect human souls to gift to the Guardian of the shadow lands. Each Kattos Foscad believe they are
  doing it for different reasons. They are quite predatory in their interactions, all things are seen through the lens of either being either predator or prey. Predators are to be
  cautiously respected, prey are an amusement at best. All humans are treated as prey until proven otherwise. This does not mean they will not respect anyone they consider prey. An 		
  entertaining hunt could lead to prey surviving for a future hunt. Predators may be treated as a threat and attacked if weakness is found. Kattos Foscad societies are small and built
  from families and prides which are multiple joined families. Within a pride life is relaxed but conflict and posturing between prides are common.

## Goblins
  Descendants of teh call of the wild might not actually be true descendants. They spawn from the call of the wild, some think they are children of the call of the wild, others think they
  are extensions and pieces of its vast consciousness. Some have tried to question the goblins about this but they don't understand. It appears Goblins live longer than a single
  incarnation but they struggle to recall last lives. Some can recall parts of their past lives but it becomes muddled and lost over time. Whilst many other fey have societies and cities,
  the goblins do not. They manifest anywhere, each manifesting a different concept and not all wish to work together. Many exist for a short time and have their own agendas and desires
  based on their concept. Occasionally a goblin is created with some sort of agenda or task they work towards from creation. This a rare and usually a sign of the call of the wild
  desiring something to be done.

## Deathless Lie
  Descendants of the mother of story and nightmare are all born of death. The first lie the mother learnt was that life could be returned after death. The deathless lie are those born of
  the first lie that the mother learnt. When their first offsprint failed to survive their grief drove the mother to declaring this lie and manifesting the first deathless lie. Now there
  are more deathless, all created by that first lie. These creature look like corpses no matter how long they have been alive. They will gather stories or lies from those that meet, using
  powers of inspiration to bring about the lies they need to feed to their mother.
