title: The Ancient Ones
---

The anicent ones are beings of immense power. Their ability to cross from the Otherworld to the mortal world is limited. There are 5 ancient ones that are known, their very will influencing both worlds.

## Guardian of the shadow lands
  The guardian of the shadow lands is an ancient feline, its fur black as pitch, its chest shines with an inner light of many colors peaking through its thick fur.
  The guardians descendants are drawn to the souls of those near death. It is not known what they do with such souls but it is thought they bring them to this ancient one.
  The shadow lands from its name is supposedly a realm no one has ever entered or atleast none has returned. The guardian once spoken to a human that found themselves lost in the other
  world and survived. He performed a service for the guardian and was granted a boon and a question. His boon was to be returned home safely and his questions was "What are the shadow
  lands and awaits those to travel there?" The answer was "I do not know, none can travel there, none can return, not even I". The human then awoke in his bed, a black cat upon his chest
  that followed him for the rest of his days, after which the cat was not seen again.
## The call of the wild
  The call of the wild is the first Goblin and the source of all goblins. It started as an urge that would coalesce around a concept and create a living being. A coallesing of power that 	
  spawn a consciousness, each time holding its memories perfectly and recalling each incarnation. This ancient one can draw power from the wilds to a concept inorder to manifect itself.
  The call of the wild is the most chaotic of the ancient one, its form and manipulations on the world change as it incarnates into different forms. For as
  long as any can remember the call to the wild as incarnated as a concept so abstract it has no physical form, instead manifesting as the urge that spawns goblins which is why the call
  of the wild thinks of all goblins as their children. This manifestation is a less powerful version of itself and happens when power builds in a given area. The power building appears 		
  random but some believe the call of the wild directs it for its own whims. But as it is incarnated as a concept that can't communicate, no one knows for sure.
## Mother of story and nightmare
  The mother f story and nightmare has been and always will be. They have existed at all times, at the same time, and aged in all times. Living for all entirety at the same time means 		
  they are always both dead and alive. They are a giant corpse that does not move, it remains where it is both alive and dead, new born and long since dust all at the same time. They have
  seen everything and know all. They are filled with every story and horror that exists. When they have their mind, body, and universe all in the same place and facing the same direction
  they can provide great knowledge to those that seek it. However this is rare. What the Mother of story and nightmare craves more than anything if lies, untruths, and fabrications. Not
  just any but stories. Lives and worlds built on lies as whiilst they know all, they can not create their own stories, they do not know how. Each new story allows them more control over
  their ability to create a story an maifest untruths. The mother has the full truth of the universe. Now they seek the full lie of the universe, one story at a time.
