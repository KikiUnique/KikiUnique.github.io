title: The Otherworld
---

The Otherworlds environments are influenced by the will of the ancient ones and the collective will of their descendants. This makes regions very different from each other and the mortal world. Each ancient one has sway over a different region with the overlaps where influences meat causing very strange landscapes.
Some of these landscapes are begining to manifest in the mortal world now that the two have been linked by the ancient ones.

# Wild Things
These creatures are the animals and less entities of the Otherworld. Some may appear to have their own sentience but they are actually controlled almost solely by the influence of the ancient ones.
