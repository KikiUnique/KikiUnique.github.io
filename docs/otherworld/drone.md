title: Otherworld Drones
---

Drones are creatures that are not sentient or sapient. This does not mean they are unable to communicate, think, plan, or feel. Drones are either mindless entities that follow a set of rules and have no subjective experience or are extensions of another entity and share their mind, either controlled or an extension of another mind. These entities are not truly sentient of sapient even when they appear to be. In the case of extensions, should the creature die or be destroyed their thoughts and experience is retained by another entity. In the case of shared intelligence the individuals are considered drones but the collect is considered sentient or sapient, the death on an individual being considered like destroying a minor body part. Drones tend not to have a will of their own to use, those individuals of a shared intelligence can utilise will but it is the will of the mind and not their own.
