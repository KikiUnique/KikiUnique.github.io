title: Otherworld Blooded and Bloodlines
---

Interactions between the Otherworld entities and the mortal world could have a lasting effect on those interacting and their descendants. These interactions can cause humans to become Imbued and result in a new Bloodline and Blooded descendants. These humans are tied to the Otherworld in a small way that has begun to manifest in different ways since the return.

# Imbued
The Imbued are the origins of a Bloodline. Becoming imbued happens during some interaction with an entity of the Otherworld. These events are rare and near impossible to replicate, it is currently unknown if or how someone will be Imbued even when replicating the same events. Being Imbued appears to have no effect on the individual. They will often live there life without knowing they have become Imbued. The Imbued are the non-blooded of a bloodline. They do not manifest any blooded traits but they do have the potential and can pass it along to their descendants. It will continue to be passed on permanently, although it is possible for an Imbued to become Imbued again by other interactions and all are passed along. However once a blood is produced all descendants of that blood only produce Imbued for the bloodline they manifested.

# Blooded Manifestation
The Imbued can manifest blooded traits at any point in life. Very rarely some are born already blooded but its is much more common to manifest during childhood or adolescence. Some still manifest during their adult years. The cause of the manifestation is varied but only one rule seem to hold true, the first Imbued in a bloodline is incapable of manifesting blooded traits.
Whilst not exhaustive below is a list of common causes that can cause manifestation of blooded traits. They don't always function that causes many to believe other criteria are also necessary but they have yet to be discovered.
 - Ritual to allow Imbued to become Blooded
 - Near-death experience
 - Intervention of powerful Otherworld being related to the bloodline

# Blooded
The members of a bloodline that manifest traits from the Otherworld. These manifest different traits based on their bloodline. Bloodlines follow parentage and there are multiple bloodlines for each type. So don't expect all blooded of a given type to be related. Each families bloodline can be slightly different as the bloodlines appear unique but fall into 5 different categories based on the believed origins of each.

## The Soulless (Lost soul to Kattos Foscad but survived and bore children)
## The Rooted (Root and Branch spore infested)
## The False (Told too many stories to a Deathless Lie or the Mother of Stories and Lies) 
## The Damned (Bargained with The Lost One)
## The Hybrids (Survived twisted creature attack)
