title: Bloodlines and Blooded
---

Interactions between the Otherworld entities and the mortal world can have a lasting effect on those interacting and their descendants. These interactions can cause humans to become Imbued and result in a new Bloodline and Blooded descendants. These humans are tied to the Otherworld in a small way that has begun to manifest in different ways since the return.

# Imbued
The Imbued are the origins of a Bloodline. Becoming imbued happens during some interaction with an entity of the Otherworld. Whilst some of these events are could be common, having them result in the creation of an Imbued is near impossible to replicate. It is currently unknown if or how someone will be Imbued even when replicating the same events. Being Imbued appears to have no effect on the individual. They will often live there life without knowing they have become Imbued. The Imbued are the non-blooded of a bloodline. They do not manifest any blooded traits but they do have the potential and can pass it along to their descendants. It will continue to be passed on permanently, although it is possible for an Imbued to become Imbued again by other interactions and all are passed along. However once a blood is produced all descendants of that blood only produce Imbued for the bloodline they manifested.

# Blooded Manifestation
The Imbued can manifest blooded traits at any point in life. Very rarely some are born already blooded but its is much more common to manifest during childhood or adolescence. Some still manifest during their adult years. The cause of the manifestation is varied but only one rule seem to hold true, the first Imbued in a bloodline is incapable of manifesting blooded traits.
Whilst not exhaustive below is a list of common causes that can cause manifestation of blooded traits. They don't always function that causes many to believe other criteria are also necessary but they have yet to be discovered.
 - Ritual to allow Imbued to become Blooded
 - Near-death experience
 - Intervention of powerful Otherworld being related to the bloodline

# Blooded
The members of a bloodline that manifest traits from the Otherworld. These manifest different traits based on their bloodline. Bloodlines follow parentage and there are multiple bloodlines for each type. So don't expect all blooded of a given type to be related. Each families bloodline can be slightly different as the bloodlines appear unique but fall into 5 different categories based on the believed origins of each.

## The Soulless
The Souless get their name from the origin of the bloodline. The Souless bloodline begins with someone that had their soul taken by Kattos Foscad but their body was resuscitated and they came back from death. It is known that the original Imbued can not have their soul taken a second time but the descendants do still have a soul at risk to Kattos Foscad.

The Soulless appear as human but with feline traits such as vertical slit eyes, pronounced canine teeth, a secondary pair of feline ears. Not all blooded develop all traits which leads to some being able to pass as human should they try.

## The Rooted
The Rooted bloodline originates from an infected of Root and Branch. Many followers are infested with spores in a minor way, they keep their mind and can commune with Root and Branch. The spores make alterations to a person that can be passed along to their descendants. The first Imbued of the bloodline is the first offspring of an infected.

The Rooted are not actually infected as the name may suggest, instead they manifest plant like bodyparts such as flowers growing from their body, vines for hair, and bark like scales over parts of their body.

## The False
The False were given their name from their connection to the Mother of Stories and Lies. The first Imbued in these bloodlines is someone that gave many stories to the mother. Having the mother hold many of your stories forms a connection that changes you on a fundamental level. Those changes pass down to your descendants.

The False become touched by the Mothers death and the blooded change deepens your connection. The blooded's skin begins to pale, dark bruise like coloring appears in areas with large muscles and around the face, their eyes color pales to white or close to it.

The marks take a shape and appearance based on their deal. They also become unable to tay in one place for long without consequence. 

Their blooded descendants are also marked with the symbols of their original Imbued appearing as if tattooed in black ink on their body in visible locations. Attmpts to cover it up shifts them over time to more visually obvious locations.
