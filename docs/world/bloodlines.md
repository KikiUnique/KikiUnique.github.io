title: Otherworld Bloodlines
---

The Otherworlds people can procreate with humans and this creates a a special bloodline. Those with Other blood appear like a cross between human and an Other. It is still not known how this works as not all that descend from a union will show the Others traits. The direct offspring might not show traits. But the connection remains and could appear further down the bloodline for reasons not currently known or may never appear.
The one thing that all Bloodlines have in common is the blood. Thus far all bloodlines can be traced through maternal connection, the lineage of these unions follows through the blood. Whilst not full confirmed as ancient bloodlines from before the divergence can manifest today, some researchers have begun finding evidence that sharing blood with another might be enough to pass the potential for that bloodline to another.

Currently it is speculated that all descendants of a bloodline have the potential to manifest should the right situation occur, even in later life. However despite return of manifesting later in life are present, the exact cause is unknown.
