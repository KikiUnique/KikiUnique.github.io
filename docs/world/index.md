## Overview
The mortal world has changed since the return and has become very different. The lands have changed, the laws fo the world no longer follow the rules we once knew. The people have started to twist and change to the new world.

## [Landscapes](/world/landscapes)
Since the return the landscapes of the mortal plane has changed greatly. With the changes, long distance travel and communication is difficult at best. Most people don't know what most of the world has experienced. But the local area has been charted and documented and it is vastly different to the world as it once was.

## [Impacts on Reality](/world/realityImpact)
When the new gods arrived the physical law of the mortal world changed and was twisted by their influence. These impacts are caused by the human world and the new gods realms overlapping. In some cases rules of the other realm has bled through to the human world, in others completely new effects have come about due to the competing realities interacting.
