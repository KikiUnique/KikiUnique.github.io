Most people don't know what most of the world has experienced. But the local area has been charted and documented and it is vastly different to the world as it once was.

When the return took place the physical law of the mortal world changed and was twisted by the influence of the Ancient Ones. The world does not follow the exact same rules as the Otherworld but a combination of physical law and the Ancient Ones influence.

Interaction between the Otherworld and the mortal world has touch some in humanity in surprising ways. Sometimes, when the circumstances are right, interactions between humans and Others can cause an individual to become Imbued with some connection between worlds. This connection spreads down the descendants of the Imbued forming a bloodline. When the circumstances are right people of a bloodline may become blooded and manifest physical traits and in some cases gain strange abilities.
