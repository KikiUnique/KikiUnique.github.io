The world we know is just one reality stacked atop many others. As humans, we have lived here most of our lived but occasionally some of us will fall through the cracks. You are one of these poor people to find themselves in the Neverwas. A world that looks like our world but the rules different.

The Neverwas is the place between realities, the place where lost fragments of place, peoples, and natural law fall to when they are lost from their realities. Over time these are merged together and become the world you now inhabit, a world of lost things and gaps to other worlds. You can travel to those other worlds but there is a price. You belong to the Neverwas now. The peoples of other worlds can not see you unless you force them to, the world rejects you in surprising ways. And the long your stay away the Neverwas the harder it is to interact with the other worlds until you are pull back to your new home.
