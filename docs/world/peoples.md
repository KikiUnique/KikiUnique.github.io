title: The Peoples of the Neverwas
---

The Neverwas is populated by the lost, the outcast, those that are no longer a part of the unified consensus reality. Those that fall through the cracks are lost to reality as if they were never part of it. Reality unravels for an instance and rewrites so those that leave never existed. History changes although minor fragments might still remain.
There are two types of creatures in the Neverwas, categorised by their entrance to the Neverwas, called forgotten and outcast.
The forgotten are peoples as a group that no longer fit the unified consensus reality and entered the Neverwas. Often, but not always, the forgotten find parts or the entirety of their civilisation has entered the Neverwas. This leaves little to no physical evidence in the world except the stories and ideas left with those that remain.
The outcasts are individuals or small groups that find themselves in the Neverwas. Outcasts almost always have a unique story to tell of how they reached the Neverwas, however no one knows what caused them to reach the Neverwas. The same actions or lead up to their transition may have been completed by many others in the world, yet they didn't end up here. Outcasts weren't common in ancient times but in the modern era outcasts have become more common. Many have theories but no one knows for certain.

Cults
Joined a group and through some believe, ritual, ceremony, or other activity found themselves int he Neverwas. Each cult has their own belief on how this happened.

Experimenters
Some experiment took place that caused a person or group to be thrown into the Neverwas. This might be an experiment on reality, experimenting creation of new substance, new medicines, High-energy physics experiments, or just a thought experiment that opened the way and pulled you through. You may be able to figure out what helped you enter, the why is still a mystery.
