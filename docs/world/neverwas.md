title: The Neverwas
---

The Neverwas is a world made up of fragments from our world that do not fit with the unified concensus of reality. A world of forgotten alleys, abandoned buildings, accursed woods, and disused structures. Creatures and beings that we know do not exist are sent here, many of which have managed to survive. They become lost to the world they were part of and manifest in the Neverwas causing it to morph and restructure itself. Often with these places come new inhabitants of those places. Others enter the world when they slip through gaps still open in the world.

The natural law of the Neverwas is unreliable and shifts as laws from different worlds bleed through and the gaps in the worlds shift. Locations move and connect in different ways, the peoples live in the most stable areas of the Neverwas. The Neverwas has no day and night cycle, each area is locked in the moment it was lost or a particular fragment of time that repeats.
