title: The Return
---
In the year 2000 AD the connections between the worlds reopened and this time the influence of the ancient fey came flooding through. They had watch the world, learning about what we achieved and saw things they did not agree upon and ensured they would not work in the otherworld should another crusade begin. As their will spread through the world our technology began to fail. Electricity didn't generate from our generators, combustion engines failed to spark, gunpowder would ignite in some cases but any attempt to fire a gun of any variety misfired with each pull of the trigger. Transport fail, infrastructure failed, modern weapons failed. Suddenly we are in a world where most countries and communities couldn't produce enough food to feed themselves, couldn't defend ourselves effectively, and were suddenly set upon my forces string than us.

At first, whilst the fey prepared and mustered their forces. Their first wave was the ancient fey changing the rules, there was no need to rush. The fear of the humans was intoxicating to them. What came next, in the chaos of unheaval, was the beasts and wild things from the otherworlds wilds. They came through and began to stalk the humans, taking joy in the prey they hadn't hunted in so long. Next came the wild hunt, as the prey in the wilds began to diminish the hunters of the wild began hunting in the human world ahead of the fey invasion. Between the change and chaos the human population was decimated before the fey came to claim their new world.

As the fey arrived and took the land they wanted more life was lost. It took time but the world found its new order, now with humans no longer at the top. Trade began between what was left of humanity and the fey of the otherworld. The most valuable resource being traded was information. Knowledge of the ancient feys rules and how to twist their rules to form rituals and magic. With the right symbolic trappings, intent, and willpower humans could use magic in a similar way to the fey.

It has been a generation since the world was lost to the fey. Humans have done their best to rebuild and learn their new place in the world. There are now people born to this world that never knew the world before. The humans are divided into many groups and factions, some ruled by the fey, others attempting to survive despite them.
