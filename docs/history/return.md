title: The Return
---
In the year 2000 AD the worlds overlapped once more and teh barrier between worlds thinned allowing the influence of the ancient ones to pass through. Connections between the worlds began to appear again and became more common, the ancient ones able to form them to suit their needs.

They had watched the world, learning about what we achieved and saw things they did not agree upon and ensured they would not work in the otherworld should another crusade begin. Electricty, petrol power, steam power, guns, modern bombs, none of which would work in the Otherworld as their will forbade it.

As their will spread through the world our technology began to fail. Electricity didn't generate from our generators, combustion engines failed to spark, gunpowder would ignite in some cases but any attempt to fire a gun of any variety misfired with each pull of the trigger. Transport failed, infrastructure failed, modern weapons failed. Bloodlines long dormant awoke with a surge. Those that should have already become blooded on the day of the return transformed with a surge causing either death or mutation beyond becoming blooded and instead becoming mindless monsters.

The turbulence of the worlds coming together again also caused chaos in the Otherworld both the wilds and the cities. The Others worked to keep their world stable as the barrier settled. The chaos and changes to the world cause many of the beasts of the world to flee in panic and found themselves in our world where they began to hunt.

Suddenly we are in a world where most countries and communities couldn't produce enough food to feed themselves, couldn't defend ourselves effectively from the encroaching creatures from the Otherworld. The human population of the world saw a sudden and dramatic decline within a couple of years. The first winter was brutal but preserved food helped prevent the worst. But with the new threats, lost of technology, and lack of preparation, the world saw depopulation down to similar levels as the middle-ages by the end of the second year. With the sheer numbers of corpses cities were abandoned. Corpses were piled up around city limits. In more rural areas where land could easily be repurposed for farming this was less of a problem although the death rate was still quick high hunting beast dealt with the corpse problem.

As the Otherworld stabilised the Others arrived and took the land they wanted and more human life was lost. It took time but the world found its new order. The Others hold power and know how to use it whilst the humans were still learning. The Ancient Ones and many entities of the Otherworld feed on mortals in one form or another. Humans are no longer the dominant species.

Trade began between what was left of humanity and the beings of the Otherworld. The most valuable resource being traded was information and the requirements of the Ancient Ones. Knowledge of the ancient ones rules and how to twist their rules to form rituals and magic was valuable to the humans for survival. The needs of the Ancients ones was valuable as a means to gain power for the Others which would help guarantee their survival.

It has been a generation since the world was lost to the Others. Humans have done their best to rebuild and learn their new place in the world.

There are now adults who were born to this world that never knew the world before. The humans are divided into many groups and factions, some ruled by the Others, others attempting to survive despite them.

The large cities are large necropolises filled with the bones of the dead and haunted by things that were drawn to the death and decay. They have become too dangerous to inhabit due to the creatures living within. Now bodies of the dead are left in the city outskirts for those that haunt the city to keep them from leaving. If they get hungry enough they start to roam.

The landscape is filled with areas where Ancient Ones have twisted the land to best suit their descendants, taking over towns and villages or forming their own. They descendants following their own agendas in how to best feed the Ancient One they serve.
