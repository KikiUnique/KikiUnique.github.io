title: The Arrival
---
The Old Gods had been looking for a new home since aeons past. As humans developed they sensed our potential and watched our development. As we grew something within us grew stronger, a hidden quality within us that would allow them to join to our world. In the year 2003 the Old Gods came to Earth and revealed themselves to us, those strongest in the hidden quality received visions and began to band together.

When the Old Gods arrived, strange effects began around the world. Technology began to fail in many different ways. Electricity didn't generate from our generators, combustion engines failed to spark, gunpowder would ignite in some cases but any attempt to fire a gun of any variety misfired with each pull of the trigger. Transport failed, infrastructure failed, modern weapons failed. Those that began to follow the Old Gods fared no better but the Old Gods ensured their crops grew in plenty. Those that refused the Old Gods found they were left to struggle as the planets infrastructure collapsed around them.
Not long after the arrival, other creatures started to appear. Monsters from our oldest stories, come to life and hunting humans. Some were quickly recognised from movies and stories, others come from half remembered memories and fears. They started to hunt humans and cause panic and chaos in the newly overturned world.

Suddenly we are in a world where most countries and communities couldn't produce enough food to feed themselves, couldn't defend ourselves effectively, and could travel long distance to seek aid. The human population of the world saw a sudden and dramatic decline within a couple of years. The first winter was brutal but preserved food helped prevent the worst. But with threat from others starving trying to take what they needed, loss of technology, and lack of preparation, the world saw a mass depopulation. With the sheer numbers of corpses cities were abandoned. Corpses were piled up around city limits. In more rural areas where land could easily be repurposed for farming and in areas where the Old Gods faithful gathered this was less of a problem.
Those strongest in that hidden quality the Old Gods sought began to perform feats that could only be described as magic or miracles. These people developed a following around the different Old Gods and with their power they were able to shelter their followers from many of the horrors to come. However, the majority of the world kept to their original beliefs and religions. They denied the Old Gods arrival and prayed and worshipped for salvation, but it never came.

As the humans that survived began to form more stable groups the depopulation began to decrease and factions began to form. Each of the Old Gods had a following, sometimes a selection of groups working together, sometimes several factions fighting amongst themselves. Factions that didn't follow the Old Gods also survived and stayed away from joining with any God. Those that followed the Old Gods began to learn rituals that would allow them to call upon their Old God for aid. These rituals were eventually given the name of Calling and worked by working with an Old God, calling on them for aid. Once these rituals began to spread, life became easier for those that survived even if it didn't become less dangerous.

Those humans that remained independent of the Old Gods began to experiment with the Callings, determined to figure out how these powers worked. Over time they began to learn how Callings worked. Over time they found a way to tap into the collective hidden quality of the world and manifest their own power without need for outside assistance. It is not perfect and has its flaws making it dangerous to use. They have also learnt how to do things not seen by the faithful of the Old Gods. These people have chosen to use archaic names for themselves and their craft, the most names are Magus and they wield Magic.
