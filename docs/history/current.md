title: Current State of the World
---

Since the arrival of the Gods the world has changed much. Whilst it hasn't been long since the world changes many of the causes of these changes are not fully understood or has become mixed up with rumour and hearsay.

The world no longer has access to advance technology. Microprocessors no longer function, complex electronics, combustion engines, and most other machines that rely on chemical or electrical energy no longer function. Even a simple firearm relying on gunpowder does not function and the gunpowder is found to be spent. When attempting to run such machines they do not function but the energy source still diminishes and at a much faster rate than the device would have, in many case it is almost instant. Strangely gunpowder when piled and ignited will react as you expect but once it is part of a machine the energy is siphoned away. It is theorised from what evidence has been found in the realm of the Dead God that the God is siphoning away the energy but only from machines. What constitutes a machine appears to be flexible and a conclusive list does not exist. It is currently not known how, why, or if this is just the mad rambling of the God.

The realms of the Gods have been linked to the human world resulting in some locations where beings may pass between the gods realms and the human world. These appear to be unique to each location although each passage between worlds seems to follow a common theme. For instance passages to the Border Lands can be found in liminal spaces and other transitional places, passages to the Garden of Lies can be found where in places like libraries, cinemas, recording studios. Not all of these locations were linked and the reason some areas contain passage ways is not know. Some passage ways appear to be temporary and will open and close at different time and new locations may manifest passage ways. It is currently not known why these passages ways change or how new ones are picked instead of others. The commonality between them is a strong connection to some trait of the Gods realm. So far no one that has entered the Gods realms have found similar passage ways between those realms. The only passages ways appear to travel between the human world and a Gods realm.

Realm Storms are seen as a new weather phenomenon that originates from the passage ways between realms. When a new passage way is created reality is effected in the surrounding area. It spread out like waves, weakening as it reaches out. After a while the storm fades and the world returns to normal. After that occasional pulses of altered reality spread out from the passage ways causing waves on altered reality to spread to the surrounding area. The effect from each passage way is variable with some having more consistent effects and others having unpredictable results. These storms are treated in a similar way that weather is treated. There is nothing that can be done to prevent it, instead you do what you can to stay comfortable and survive the effects.

Large cities have been abandoned and are seen as dangerous places fo the dead. Large cities are now home to Charonians that have become more feral than those from the Border lands. During the arrival many people died in the cities and attracted the Charonians. They now treat the cities as their territory and defend them with a feral anger against any who enter them. When their food supply gets low they begin to hunt in the area around the cities and begin to spread out, attacking anyone they find. Cities are now treated as a place that the dead are taken to. So long as corpses are supplied on a regular basis these feral Charonians do not leave their cities. Occasionally people will enter the cities hunting for items from before the arrival despite the dangers.

Civilisation has become tribal once more, the world being divided into different settlements. Some of them may have alliances and agreements but each still consider themselves independent of each other. Each settlement is based around a God or group and those from the group that do not share the settlements group identity are unable to stay. For each group the reason for this differs but there are a few things common to all settlements. For those based around a God their rituals are strengthened by those loyal to the God and weakened by those that are not. In order to keep favour with their God those not loyal must leave. For the independent groups the presence of those loyal to a God can corrupt the groups independence which is a threat to their existence and differing philosophies of independent groups causes conflicts that can destroy settlements. Everyone has an affiliation with a settlement as its God or Group, to not have one leaves a person without a group to help support them makes survival near impossible.
