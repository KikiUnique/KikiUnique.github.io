title: The Divergence
---

The world before 1000 AD, the stories of supernatural creatures are true to a point. Humans got many things wrong but some of the old stories held the truth if you knew where to look.

The human world and the otherworld overlapped, the otherworld following different natural law to the human world. The law of magic is controlled by the ancient ones whose collective believe or concept of reality shapes the laws of their world. The other world is the source of the stories around the fey and other mythical creatures. Many more are the scions of things from the Otherworld and human, making vampires, werewolves, and other half human creatures. In 1000 AD the forgotten crusade was launched by the human into the otherworld. The humans made it through the wilds, through the twisted landscapes of the Otherworld, and to the seats of the ancient ones. Amidst the fighting the humans made it to the seat of the ancients and requested a deal. The exact wording was lost with the crusade when the deal was struck but all of humanity learnt what it did when the world changed. For 1000 years the ancient ones, their influence, and the otherworld will leave the human world in peace.

Unfortunately the ancient ones were not influencing the human world. Their children had influence over those that struck deals with them but the ancient ones could not shape our world. But the deal was too vague. The ancient ones had no influence already but that would change after 1000 years of separation. The crusade launched thought they would have 1000 years to prepare for a final confrontation. However, they actually were lost in the otherworld during the separation and signed the world over to the ancient ones when they return. Separation and no influence did nto stop the otherworld scrying to watch the human world and prepare for time they could claim it as their own.
