Much has happened in the years since the Old Gods arrived. Events since then that would be common knowledge have been included here. There may be more to these events known to those that were there, gossip, rumour, and hearsay have a way of distorting the truth.

The world has begun to settle since the chaos and changes are taking place. There are now adults who were born to this world that never knew the world before. Some humans that are still independent have began learning how magic works and begun manifesting their own power without need for outside assistance. It has its flaws making it dangerous to use but they have also learnt how to do things not seen by the faithful of the Old Gods or the Guardians of the Genius Loci.

The large cities are large necropolises filled with the bones of the dead and haunted by things that were drawn to the death and decay. They have become too dangerous to inhabit due to the creatures living within. Now bodies of the dead are left in the city outskirts for those that haunt the city to keep them from leaving. If they get hungry enough they start to roam.

The workd has become subject to the whims of the Old Gods with strange effects spreading and flowing across the world like clouds affecting all in the area. These disturbances are commonly called the new weather and the ability to predict them is difficult at best.

It took years, but eventually it was discovered the quality within humans that drew the Old Gods was the cause of the disruption to our technology. Once the Old Gods arrived and amplified if for their own purposes the technology began to fail. Once we understood what was happening many of the faithful, guardians, and later the independent humans learnt how to create charge stones. These stones could power some old world technology with a few modifications. Simple circuits and motors could be powered, complex processors would fail. As the stones were experimented with they discovered how to use smaller stones to propel bullets in modified and custom-made firearms. They were bulkier and had a shorter range, but they worked.
