title: Mortal World Physical Law
---

The mortal world was not a world of subjective laws but static, observables, repeatable laws called physical law. But for the occasional incursion from the Otherworld before the divergence the laws of the mortal world have followed the same rules for 1000s of years.
The laws of the mortal world have not been destroyed, they have been supplemented with new laws layers on top. These are called physical law, anicent law, ritual law.

## Physical Law
Physical law are the rules of the world from before the return. Cause and effect, laws of motion, laws of thermodynamic, laws of universal gravity, all scientifically tested and proven laws are counted as part of physical law. All the laws that existed for our world are still present in the world as the base set of laws. The ancient and ritual law site on top of these, twisting them, changing them, and in some case completely removing them.

## Ancient Law
Ancient law are the rules imposed by the Ancient Ones influence. Sitting on top of the physical laws they are either entirely new laws or twisted versions of existing laws. These laws of dictated and controlled by the Ancient Ones immense will. Ancient law is commonly divided into two categories. Global and local.

### Global Ancient Law
Global Ancient Law are the laws imposed by the ancient ones on the entire mortal world. These were the first laws to be imposed after the return and caused the worst of the chaos that followed. Since the return and some experiments by those that survived the following laws discovered have been classified as follows.
 - Law of explosive propulsion  
  Explosive material can still detonate in open environments, attempts to cause an explosive action in a way to harness its energy fails every time. This includes but is not limited to firing bullets, vehicles, and bombs.
 - Law of harnessed electricity  
  Electrical generation and storage is no longer possible. Generators no longer build up a charge and storage devices no longer discharge energy. Since the return rituals have been discovered that can charge a charge stone. These charge stones can be used in place of a battery with limitations. Charge stones come from a ritual with restrictions on their use dictated by the being that creates it such as lighting a single building, powering a single mobility aid. These charge stones recharge when left out in sunlight, although we don't know how or why.
 - Law of Overlap  
  The barrier between world has weakened and fluctuating gaps larger than ever seen before has opened and ripple across the barrier. This is the after effect of the return and maintained and manipulated by the ancient ones. These gaps open, close, and move around to the pattern that can be predicted but not in a precise way. Amount disturbance and possibility of openings can be predicted in the new future but its less accurate the further into the future you look. There are some places the ancient ones maintain permanent openings. These are not common and are usually within an area where ancient ones have a greater degree of control.

### Local Ancient Law
Local Ancient Law are changes to the world that only exist locally. These are usually present only in stable areas influenced over by an ancient one. These laws are tied to an area and not an ancient one. Not all of an ancient ones territory share the same laws. Due to the inconsistency of these laws it is common for signs to be made by humans that have learnt the rules and left at points around the bounds of the territory affected by the laws.

On top of these, there are local ancient laws that are not created by the ancient ones but appears to be manifest with the wilds of the otherworld. These are not connected to a territory and shift across the world almost like a storm.

## Ritual Law
Ritual Law are changes to the world that happen on a much smaller scale. Potentially affect a small region, a building, or a person. These laws are produced by rituals or deals made with ancient ones or beings of great power.

These ritual laws tend to be temporary unlike Ancient Law. Whilst some local ancient law my move and shift like a storm, they remain permanent. Ritual law is only ever temporary. Even if it is a permanent deal with an ancient one, it is still ritual law, temporary, and one that the ancient one chooses to renew.
