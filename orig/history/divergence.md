## Before the Divergence

The world was once full of monsters. Before 1000 AD, the stories of supernatural creatures were true to a point. We got many things wrong and other things have been lost through time but some of the old stories held the truth if you knew where to look.

Our universe is larger than we ever knew beyond the physical world around us. A second world exists around us on another plane, overlapping but not connected in a consistent or predictable way. Creatures from the Otherworld have found ways to cross between worlds and were seen as monsters to the humans that encountered them. The crossing was not easy and rare. Many of our stories of monsters and the supernatural were actually descendant bloodlines of human and things from the Otherworld. Where victims of the Others mixed blood in combat a bloodline would form and hybrids would manifest along the blood line sporadically and seemingly with no cause.

Over the ages more and more individuals affected by the bloodlines of the Others. In the lead up to the divergence the number of those manifesting bloodlines increased dramatically. In an effort to stem the tide a cabal of scholars, practitioners of magic, and clerics of the church began in secret to plan a solution to what they saw as an incursion of otherworldly monsters.

Hidden in the power structures of the kingdoms, empires, and states of the world. They worked in secret to discover the cause of the supernatural. By 1000 AD this group had grown in members and influence, and finally would an Other that had crossed over from whom they gleamed much. Learning of the ancient ones, their influence, and what they saw as the corruption of their fellow human a plan was forged. With the ancient ones Will controlling physical law of the Otherworld and able to alter this bound by an oath of word, the right deal could have the ancient ones locked away from the world until the cabal had the means to deal with them once and for all.

## The Forgotten Crusade
The Cabal worked in secret to prepare soldiers from allies across the world. The Otherworld did nto have a single entrance, entrances were fluid and ever-changing. Each crossing happened organically with many different requirements. Except the Cabal had learnt that with the right preparations the barrier could be made fragile and easier parted and stepped through. With bands of soldiers across the known world ready the rituals began. The barrier between worlds parted and the soldiers marched through.

Years later, after the Crusades of the Holy Roman Empire, information regarding the Cabal and what happened would lead to this being called either the First Crusade or more commonly the Forgotten Crusade. The soldier of the Forgotten Crusade stepped through the barrier into a strange world. Several would be lost having performed the ritual slightly differently and ending up elsewhere in the Otherworld, lost and alone. The bulk of the force arrived in the other world and the barriers closed. From this point on, we don't know what happened, the people left in the mortal world only know that the tales of monsters became less and many were fabrications or distortions of the trust. It was believed they were successfully but all the soldiers were lost.

After the return of the Others some information regarding the divergence become common knowledge. The soldiers arrived in a wooded area. They moved through the lands, set upon by wild beasts and made their way to an abandoned city of bone. Many soldiers died in the city but it was eventually claimed by the Cabal. From their they found the vacant seat of an Ancient One but no one knows which. The scholars brought on the crusade proposed their deal in that chamber and the worlds diverged. The Otherworld fell into chaos as the barrier between worlds became impassable. The soldiers were lost.

## A Deal is Struck
The deal the Cabal wanted came into effect although exact wording was lost. Since the return of the Otherworld humanity has been made aware of the deal as it was understood by the inhabitants of the Otherworld.

For 1000 years the ancient ones, their influence, and the Otherworld will leave the mortal world in peace.

The entity they had interrogated had been crafty. It led them to believe it could not lie and used crafty wordplay to attempt to mislead. The Cabal thought this like the stories of Fey and their deals but was further from the truth. The entity could live and fed them false information that they believed must be true. They thought the Ancient Ones had influence the human world. Their descendants had minor influence over their surroundings and those that forged pacts with them, but they did not. This lie lead to world we have today. The dealings words left a loophole, after 1000 years their influence could enter the mortal world and with it control of physical law and the barrier between the worlds.

## The Divergence
In the mortal world, nothing of note happened. The world continued as the history books tell. The stories of monsters and supernatural no longer had causes from the Otherworld. In private, behind closed doors the Cabal continue to work on plans to deal with the Ancient Ones. This was until the Holy Roman Empire and their crusades. The Cabal had many groups spread out across Europe focused on the Ancient Ones problem. During the Crusades, holy wars, and inquisitions that following all of the surviving Cabals groups were discovered, exposed, considered heretical, and destroyed along with their gathered knowledge. By 1100AD much of the Cabal was destroyed with a few groups remaining in secret but eventually the last of them were caused during the inquisitions of the 13th century.

In the Otherworld, the Ancient Ones and their descendants waited. In 1000 years they would gain new ands and grow in power. Each ancient one hungered for something that human could provided. With the barrier open to them and being able to manipulate the world to better suit their needs would be a great boon to them. They waited patiently watching the mortal world through different means. No influencing, or interacting. Just observing the world and the mortals, how they changed and grew. They planned and changed their influence over their world so when it bled into the mortal world they would better take control of their new world from the humans.

During the time the soldiers of the Forgotten Crusade were lost, the city of bone now empty but for the bones of those that died there. The ancient ones seat remains vacant and none have moved to claim it and prestige of being the one that bound the mortal world to theres.
