title: OtherWorld Overview
---

The Otherworld is a strange world very different to the Mortal world that was. The world follows different physical law controlled and manipulated by its inhabitants. This results are a world where symbolic connections, dream logic, and force of will dictate what is possible.

# Landscape
The landscape of the Otherworld is one of change with pockets of stable environments maintained by the collect will of the inhabitants. The wild lands are the areas where little to no will is used to stable it. THe wild lands are subject to change based on the subconscious and emotions of the Ancient ones. Wild lands closest to an Ancient One is predominantly influenced by that one alone. As the wild lands get further away the influence of multiple Ancient Ones start to have an impact.
Outside of the wild lands are the Other Lands where will keeps the lands mostly stable. The Other Lands are maintained in different ways, some are maintained directly by an Ancient One, often refered to as the City of the Ancients. Others are held stable by the collective will of a group of entities with a common believe in how the Other Land should be. Cities of the Ancients are the most stable of areas, the Other Lands can fluctuate over time or as a result of major events affecting the inhabitants. 

# Physical Law
All the inhabitants of the world are born with an instinct on utilising their will to some effect. Prey animals can use it to disguise themselves, appearing in the minds of others as a part of the landscape. Hunting animals use their will to calm prey whilst they are being stalked. Sapient beings use it in minor ways to aid in their lives. Larger groups use their collective will to influence larger areas of the world, many times subconsciously. THe Ancient Ones of beings with a vast will able to bend the very laws of the world to their will, the physical law of the world being warped to their subconscious needs and desires.

# Inhabitants
There are many inhabitants of the Otherworld that have proven difficult to categorise by the Humans that have tried to apply some level of scientific classification to them. The existing categories did not work for creatures created or changed by the will of other entities or their own perceptions. The categories that divided the entities of the Otherworld in the cleanest matter was a follows.

## Drone
Drones are creatures that are not sentient or sapient. This does not mean they are unable to communicate, think, plan, or feel. Drones are either mindless entities that follow a set of rules and have no subjective experience or are extensions of another entity and share their mind, either controlled or an extension of another mind. These entities are not truly sentient of sapient even when they appear to be. In the case of extensions, should the creature die or be destroyed their thoughts and experience is retained by another entity. In the case of shared intelligence the individuals are considered drones but the collect is considered sentient or sapient, the death on an individual being considered like destroying a minor body part. Drones tend not to have a will of their own to use, those individuals of a shared intelligence can utilise will but it is the will of the mind and not their own.

## Sentient
Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, and have subjective experiences, such as emotions and sensations like pain or pleasure. Sentient creatures also only make an instinctual use of their will. Their will is used without conscious thought and is used for survival or for immediate need. The difference between these and sapient entities is the difference between humans and animals. 

## Sapient
Sapience, a higher-level trait, involves wisdom, self-awareness, judgment, and complex thought, allowing for abstract reasoning and understanding of oneself within the universe. Sapient creatures can use their will in a multitude of way beyond instinct and survival to explore, improvement, and change their place in the universe. Whilst all entities of the Otherworld can grow their will, Sapient entities are capable of actively seeking to improve their will.

## Ancient Ones
Ancient Ones are a special categorisation of Sapient entity that have grown their will till they reach a given set of abilities or attributes. A sapient entity is considered an Ancient One once they are capable of maintaining and manipulating physical law of the entire world and sustaining themselves eternally by some means. There are currently 5 Ancient Ones in the Otherworld whose influence has spread to the mortal world.
